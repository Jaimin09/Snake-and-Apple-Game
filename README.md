# Slither
A fun Snake-and-Apple game in which everytime the snake eats an apple, its length increases. If the snake goes out of the boundary or bites itself, then the game is over. The final score is displayed at the end of the game.

We all must have played this game in our childhood. And its still a fun to see if we can beat our own previous record. Its a fun challenge we like to accept !

# Features :
- The score gets updated everytime the snake eats and apple
- You can play/pause the game anytime

It is coded using pygame in python !
